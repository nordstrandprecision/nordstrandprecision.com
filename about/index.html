				<p>Our founder and president, Erich Baur, was first exposed to the world of manufacturing early in his engineering career at the University of California, Davis. Although he completed the necessary manufacturing courses to earn his degree, Erich wouldn't get a full appreciation of machining until working in a machine shop just a few years later. While starting at the bottom as a shop helper at an older, corporate machine shop, Erich quickly learned the fundamentals and worked alongside machinists, engineers, supply chain, and shop management through the day-in and day-out.<br><br>After a few months, Erich was promoted to process engineer, and a couple years later was selected to move to Colorado and build a state-of-the-art machine shop. There in Colorado, he worked alongside a small team to purchase capital, tooling, and build a world-class, 20,000 square foot precision manufacturing facility. Over the next 2 years, Erich gained experience in programming, process engineering, machining, project coordination, supply chain, and shop management.<br><br>Once established, Erich dove deeper into the machining industry, working for and with other machine shops and machine tool builders to shape his network and industrial career. He continues to expand his manufacturing knowledge and dutifully serves his customers and community. He lives and works happily with his wife in Colorado.</p>
